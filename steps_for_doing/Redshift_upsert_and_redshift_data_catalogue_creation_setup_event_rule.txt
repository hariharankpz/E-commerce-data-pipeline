How to setup the event rule - to trigger SNS or lambda once ETL glue job completes?
This event pattern is specifically configured to trigger actions when a particular AWS Glue job (your_glue_job_name) completes successfully (SUCCEEDED). 
Hereâ€™s how this event pattern works:

{
  "source": ["aws.glue"],
  "detail-type": ["Glue Job State Change"],
  "detail": {
    "jobName": ["your_glue_job_name"],
    "state": ["SUCCEEDED"]
  }
}



Explanation:
source: Specifies that the events are generated by AWS Glue (aws.glue).
detail-type: Specifies that the events are related to changes in the state of AWS Glue jobs (Glue Job State Change).
detail: Specifies detailed criteria to match within the event:
jobName: A list of Glue job names to match. In this case, it's set to ["your_glue_job_name"], meaning the rule will trigger only for the Glue job with the name your_glue_job_name.
state: A list of job states to match. Here, it's set to ["SUCCEEDED"], so the rule will trigger only when the specified Glue job transitions to the SUCCEEDED state.

Use Case:
This event pattern is useful when you want to automate actions that depend on the successful completion of a specific Glue job.
 For example, you can configure a Lambda function as a target for this CloudWatch Events rule.
 The Lambda function can perform tasks such as:

1. Initiating an upsert operation in Amazon Redshift.
2. Sending notifications about job completion.
3. Triggering subsequent data processing or analysis tasks.



#Once This Glue ran succesfullly create event bridge rule to trigger the SNS to send SMS or email and then this SNS will also trigger the lambda (add lambda's trigger as same SNS) to archive the data in s3 from source s3
